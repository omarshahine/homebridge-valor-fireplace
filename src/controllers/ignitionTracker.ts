/**
 * Tracks ignition attempts and persists their outcomes to disk.
 *
 * **Why this exists.** The Mertik GV60 receiver has its own internal
 * ignition logic: when we send the Ignite command (`314103`), it opens
 * the gas valve, sparks repeatedly for ~30-60s, and then either:
 *
 *  - **Success**: the thermopile confirms flame, `guardFlameOn` goes true,
 *    `igniting` clears to 0.
 *  - **Soft failure**: the receiver gives up cleanly. `igniting` clears
 *    back to 0 but `guardFlameOn` stays 0. This is the common cold-start
 *    case — air in the pilot tube, cold thermopile, marginal gas pressure.
 *    Resolves on the next attempt 80% of the time.
 *  - **Hard lockout**: the `igniting` bit stays stuck at 1 indefinitely.
 *    This is the safety-lockout state — the receiver tripped its fault
 *    and only a paperclip reset or service visit clears it.
 *
 * This tracker doesn't drive retries directly; the controller's
 * `igniteFireplace()` does that with explicit `Attempt N of M` logging.
 * The tracker's job is to record each attempt's outcome, persist the
 * history under the homebridge `storagePath` so it survives plugin
 * restarts and log rotations, and expose the consecutive-failure count
 * to the controller's circuit breaker.
 *
 * Persistence file: `<storagePath>/valor-ignition-history.json`. The
 * previous all-in-memory approach lost every diagnostic the moment
 * homebridge rotated its log.
